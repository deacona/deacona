## 🔭 I’m currently working on ...

I work for [Findmypast](findmypast.co.uk/) transforming digitised historical documents into high quality genealogical resources. This involves structured and un-structured data, web-scraping, 3rd party APIs, special data protection requirements, machine learning models, and pipeline automation.

## 🌱 My public projects ...

### Climate misinformation

For the last year or so I have volunteered with this AI For Good community project. It's aim is to combat climate misinformation, greenwashing and climate-related fake news. I have contributed to the project's Data Science code repository.
